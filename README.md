# React Contact Manager

#### Summary

This is a simple project based off a React course I completed which allows users to manage contacts.

#### Some of the concepts & technologies I learned through this course:

- Implementing a Redux store
- Connecting components to application level state via action creators
- Modifying application level state via reducers
- Using the Context API to manage application level state (Was replaced with Redux)
- Connecting a fake REST API (http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to our reducers and serving state to components
- Handling component lifecycle methods
